# Sign Language Interpreter 

A recent estimate claims that around 13 million people have some level of proficiency in American Sign Language, making it the third most commonly used language in the United States. 

The goal of our project is to create a system that will convert video feed of a person signing in American Sign Language into English text. We hope to encourage communication between those who have no other way of expressing their ideas other than using Sign Language and those who do not know how to sign. We hope to cater to the 500,000 deaf people in the US and Canada whoâ€™s natural language is the American Sign Language (ASL), and work towards creating a more inclusive environment.

We use a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and LSTMs to tackle this problem.
